            <p id="p1">I'm Abigail Buchwald, I'm a graphic designer based in the Boston area. I grew up in Colorado, but have also lived in North Carolina, Massachusetts, and Italy. This diverse cultural background has allowed me to bring a unique multi-cultural influence into my work.<br>
            <p id="p2">My parents knew I would go into design before I did. My mom always tells this story about me drawing a wooden model as a ballerina at a children's area in an art museum. I was about 5 or 6 years old and a worker came up to my mother and said, “I have never seen a child so focused on what they are making”. My mom claims that was the point she knew I would go into a creative field. When I got older I had aspirations of going into Physics or Engineering, but then realized I need to be actively creating in order to function. Graphic design has been the perfect medium between visual creation and analytical, mathematical design.</p>
